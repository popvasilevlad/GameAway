# GameAway

Simple client-server game-app made with node.js, using the following packages: express, react, redux, styled-components, socket.io, react-cookies and jest.

The client runs on port 3000 and the server on port 8080. Please make sure they are not already used.

After cloning the repo, please run these commands:
    
    npm install

    npm run installApp

    npm run startApp
    
    
 If the commands above don't work, try installing and running the server and the client app separately
 
   Install and start the server:

        cd server/

        npm install

        node index.js


 Install and start the client:

        cd client/

        npm install

        npm start
    
 Enjoy :)
